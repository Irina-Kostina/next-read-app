# ðŸ“š NextRead

NextRead is a simple and smart **book recommendation app** that helps people find their next great read based on their interests, favourite genres, and authors.

---

## App Purpose

**NextRead** is built to make it easy and fun for users to discover new books theyâ€™ll enjoy.

When you finish a book, it can be hard to decide what to read next â€” there are too many choices online. **NextRead** solves this problem by showing book suggestions based on what you already like.

You can:

- Search for books by title, author, or genre.
- Filter results by language or rating.
- Save your favourites to keep track of what you love.
- Get smart recommendations (currently rule-based) â€” for example:
  > If you liked _The Hobbit_, youâ€™ll see more fantasy adventure books.

The goal of **NextRead** is to make book discovery personal and effortless â€” like having a friendly reading assistant who always knows what youâ€™ll enjoy next.

## How It Works

1. **Search for books** using the search bar.
2. **Apply filters** to narrow down results (by author, genre, or rating).
3. **Click on a book card** to view details.
4. **Add books to your favourites** to build your personal reading list.
5. **View recommendations** on the home page when you havenâ€™t searched yet â€” these are generated based on your past favourites or last read genre.
